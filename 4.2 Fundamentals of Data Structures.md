## Data Structures and Abstract Data Types
**Data Structures**
+ **Data Structure** is a collection of data that is organised for easy processing
	+ **Dynamic Data Structure** is a collection of data in memory that can grow or shrink in size. E.g. Python's list
  + **Heap** is memory allocated at run-time for new items to be added to dynamic data structure
  + **Static Data Structure** is fixed in size at a compilation time and cannot be resized to hold more items or to remove items to free up memory
    + E.g. a static array in VB. Python does not have a built-in array type
    
**Single and Multi-Dimensional Arrays**
+ **Array** is a collection of elements with **the same** data type
+ **One-dimensional array** has a single index to indicate the location/order of an item in the structure
+ **Two dimensional array** has two indices to indicate the location/order of an item in the structure such as a matrix or a grid
+ **Three dimensional array** has three indices, such as points in a cube

## Abstract Data Types/Data Structures
**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a logical description of how the data is viewed and the operations can be performed on it, but how to implement it may not be known

**Stacks**
+ **Stack** is an abstract data type with a collection of elements where a new element is added to the top of the stack (push) and the most recently element is removed (pop) first
+ A stack has the following operations performed on it:
 + **push**: add a new item to the top of the stack
 + **pop**: remove the most recently added element from the top of the stack
 + **peek or top**: read the content of the top element without modifying it
 + **isFull**: check if the stack is full
 + **isEmpty**: check if the stack is empty

**Queues**:
+ A **queue** is a first in, first out (FIFO) data structure
+ New element is added to the end of the queue
+ Elements can only be retrieved from the start of the queue
+ The order of the elements are the order in which they are inserted
+ Queues can be implemented using Array, Linked-list, Pointer
+ Queues can be used for:
  + printing: jobs to be printed is stored on disk in a queue. The printer prints them in the order it receives - first come, first print. This allows users to work on other tasks after sending the printing jobs to the queue.
  + Keyboard buffer queue: characters stored in a queue in a keyboard buffer.
+ Regardless what is used to implement a queue, the operations are the same
+ **Operations on queues**:
  + add a new item to the queue (**enQueue()**)
  + retrieve the item at the start of the queue (**peek**)
  + remove an item from the start of the queue (**deQueue()**)
  + check if a queue is empty (**isEmpty()**)
  + check if a fixed size queue is full (**isFull()**)
+ A **linear queue** is one way of implementing a queue data structure using array
  + New element added to the end
  + When removing an item from the start, all other elements move up one position
  	+ If the queue is very long, re-organising/re-positioning each element can take a long time
