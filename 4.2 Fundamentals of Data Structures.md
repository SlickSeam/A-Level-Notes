# Data Structures and Abstract Data Types
**Data Structures**
+ **Data Structure** is a collection of data that is organised for easy processing
	+ **Dynamic Data Structure** is a collection of data in memory that can grow or shrink in size. E.g. Python's list
  + **Heap** is memory allocated at run-time for new items to be added to dynamic data structure
  + **Static Data Structure** is fixed in size at a compilation time and cannot be resized to hold more items or to remove items to free up memory
    + E.g. a static array in VB. Python does not have a built-in array type
    
**Single and Multi-Dimensional Arrays**
+ **Array** is a collection of elements with **the same** data type
+ **One-dimensional array** has a single index to indicate the location/order of an item in the structure
+ **Two dimensional array** has two indices to indicate the location/order of an item in the structure such as a matrix or a grid
+ **Three dimensional array** has three indices, such as points in a cube

# Abstract Data Types/Data Structures
**Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a logical description of how the data is viewed and the operations can be performed on it, but how to implement it may not be known

##Stacks:
+ **Stack** is an abstract data type with a collection of elements where a new element is added to the top of the stack (push) and the most recently element is removed (pop) first
+ A stack has the following operations performed on it:
 + **push**: add a new item to the top of the stack
 + **pop**: remove the most recently added element from the top of the stack
 + **peek or top**: read the content of the top element without modifying it
 + **isFull**: check if the stack is full
 + **isEmpty**: check if the stack is empty

##Queues::
+ A **queue** is a first in, first out (FIFO) data structure
+ New element is added to the end of the queue
+ Elements can only be retrieved from the start of the queue
+ The order of the elements are the order in which they are inserted
+ Queues can be implemented using Array, Linked-list, Pointer
+ Queues can be used for:
  + printing: jobs to be printed is stored on disk in a queue. The printer prints them in the order it receives - first come, first print. This allows users to work on other tasks after sending the printing jobs to the queue.
  + Keyboard buffer queue: characters stored in a queue in a keyboard buffer.
+ Regardless what is used to implement a queue, the operations are the same
+ **Operations on queues**:
  + add a new item to the queue (**enQueue()**)
  + retrieve the item at the start of the queue (**peek**)
  + remove an item from the start of the queue (**deQueue()**)
  + check if a queue is empty (**isEmpty()**)
  + check if a fixed size queue is full (**isFull()**)
+ A **linear queue** is one way of implementing a queue data structure using array
  + New element added to the end
  + When removing an item from the start, all other elements move up one position
  	+ If the queue is very long, re-organising/re-positioning each element can take a long time
+ Another way to implement a **linear queue** is to use pointers:
  + The size of the queue is known
  + The current number of elements is known
  + One pointer is used to always point to the first element from the start of the queue
  + The other pointer is used to always point to the last element at the end of the queue
  + When an element is dequeued, the pointer points to the next element, resulting in an empty space that cannot be used at the front
+ A **circular queue** is a queue when the end pointer has reached the last element, when a new item is added, it points to the start of the queue, thus forms a circle
  + One pointer points to the first element
  + The other pointer points to the last element at the end of the queue
  + Add an element to the end of the queue and move the end pointer along
  + Remove element form the front of the queue and move the pointer to the next element at the front
  + After some deleting/removing operations, all available spaces are at the front of the queue, the end pointer will point to the starting position of the queue, thus forming a circular queue
+ **Priority queue** is a queue data structure where additionally each element has a **priority** associated with it.
  + In a priority queue, an element with high priority is always removed before an element with low priority
  + Priority queue can be used by the OS's scheduling program where certain system processes are given a higher priority than user processes
    + E.g. a runtime error such as divide by zero, read/write file not found

##Lists:
+ **A list** is a collection of ordered elements of different data types, in contrast to array where all elements are of the same data type

##Graphs:
**Graphs Basics**
+ **Graphs** are data structures that consist of a finite number of vertices/nodes/points and edges/arcs/lines connecting those vertices/nodes/points
+ Graphs can be **undirected**,**directed** and **weighted**
+ The edges/arcs/lines between nodes can be used to represent complex relationship
  + Arrows on edges/arcs/lines can be used for directional relationships
    + If edges on a graph are all one-way, the graph is a **directed graph** or **digraph**
  + Attributes/values can be associated with edges/arcs/lines to specify the nature of relationships
  + Those edges with values are **weighted** edges

**Application of Graphs**
+ Finite state machine
+ Roads between townsn and cities with distances as weights
+ Computer networks: computers and devices as nodes and bandwidth as weights
+ Website: the vertices represent web pages and directed edges represent links from one page to another
+ In chemistry a graph makes a natural model for a molecule, where vertices represent atoms and edges bonds.
+ In biology and convervation efforts where a vertex can represent regions where certain species exist (or inhabit) and the edges represent migration paths, or movement between the regions

**Operations on a Graph**
+ Adding a node
+ Deleting a node
+ Adding an edge
+ Deleting an edge
+ Checking if there is an edge between node A and B
+ Finding the successors of a given vertex
+ Finding a path between two vertices

**Implementing Graphs - Adjacent Matrix and Adjacent List**
+ **Adjacency Matrix**:
  + Using a 2D array, a weighted or unweighted graph can be implemented
    + **Advantages of Adjacency Matrix**:
      + Easy to add or remove an edge
      + Easy to check if an existing edge
    + **Disadvantages of Adjacency Matrix**:
      + The larger the graph (more nodes), the more memory is needed
      + For a sparse graph, space will be wasted for not storing many edges
      + If static array is used for the matrix, adding or deleting nodes may not be easy
