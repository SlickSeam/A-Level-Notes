## 3.5.1 Number Systems
**Natural Numbers**
+ Definition: These are numbers used for counting.
+ Examples: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
``` 
Counting uses natural number
A set of natural number can expressed as:
N={0,1,2,3...}

```

**Integer Numbers**
+ Definition: Any whole number.
+ Examples: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2

**Rational Numbers**
+ Definition: Any number that can be written as a fraction
+ Examples: -1, 0, 1.2, 1/3, 5.5

**Irrational Numbers**
+ Definition: Any number that cannot be written as a fraction
+ Examples: π, √2, √3

**Real numbers**
+ Definition: Any possible real world quantities
+ Examples: √2, 1.23, 3.142, -3, -2, -1, 0, 111, 245.56, 3

**Ordinal numbers**
+ Definition: Used to tell the position of something in a list
+ Examples: List = (a, b, c, d)
	+ *'a' is the 1st object in the list, 'b' is the 2nd object in the list, etc...*


## 3.5.2 Number Bases
**Base 2**
+ Definition: These are binary numbers and are only made of 2 digits (0 and 1). 
+ Place Values: 2<sup>0</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, etc...
+ Example: 1010<sub>2</sub>

**Base 10**
+ Definition: These are decimal/denary numbers which use 10 digits to make up their numbers
+ Place Values: 10<sup>0</sup>, 10<sup>1</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>, 10<sup>3</sup>, etc...
+ Example: 26<sub>10</sub>

**Base 16**
+ Definition: These are hexadecimal numbers
+ Symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

**Conversion Between Denary, Binary and Hex**

| Binary | Hexadecimal | Decimal |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| 0000   | 0           | 0       |
| 0001   | 1           | 1       |
| 0010   | 2           | 2       |
| 0011   | 3           | 3       |
| 0100   | 4           | 4       |
| 0101   | 5           | 5       |
| 0110   | 6           | 6       |
| 0111   | 7           | 7       |
| 1000   | 8           | 8       |
| 1001   | 9           | 9       |
| 1010   | A           | 10      |
| 1011   | B           | 11      |
| 1100   | C           | 12      |
| 1101   | D           | 13      |
| 1110   | E           | 14      |
| 1111   | F           | 15      |

+ For example: 10101101
	+ Split into nibbles - 1010 1101 ---> Convert each to decimal - 10 13 ---> Convert each to hex - AD

## 3.5.3 Units of Information
**Bits and Bytes**
+ A **bit** is either a 0 or 1
	+ Binary numbers are made up of bits
	+ A **byte** is made up of a group of 8 bits
	+ A **nibble** is a made up of a group of 4 bits
	
**Kilobytes and Kibibytes**
+ A kilobyte is 1000 (10<sup>3</sup>) bytes
+ A kibibyte is 1024 (2<sup>10</sup>) bytes
	+ Kibi is the **ki**lo in **bi**nary

| Kilobyte (KB) | 1000   | Kibibyte (KiB) | 1024   |
|---------------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Megabyte (MB)** | **1000<sup>2</sup>** | **Mebibyte (MiB)** | **1024<sup>2</sup>** |
| **Gigabyte (GB)** | **1000<sup>3</sup>** | **Gibibyte (GiB)** | **1024<sup>3</sup>** |
| **Terabyte (TB)** | **1000<sup>4</sup>** | **Tebibyte (TiB)** | **1024<sup>4</sup>** |
| **Petabyte (PB)** | **1000<sup>5</sup>** | **Pebibyte (PiB)** | **1024<sup>5</sup>** |
	 
  	  	  	 
## 3.5.4 Binary Number System
**Unsigned Binary**
+ These do not have a bit to indicate that they are positive or negative numbers.
+ An 8 bit **unsigned binary** number has a max value of 255 and there are 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) different values

**Unsigned Binary Arithmetics**
+ Binary addition rules:
	+ 0+0=0
	+ 0+1=1
	+ 1+1=10 (meaning the 1 is carried over and the number stays as 0)
	+ 1+1+1=10+1=11 (meaning the 1 is carried over and the number becomes 1)
+ Addition:
``` Examples
 1010                               1010
+0010                              +1111
  1< carry over the bit              1<
-----                               1< carry over the bits
 1100                              -----
                                   11000
```                                
+ Binary multiplication rules:
	+ 0x0=0
	+ 1x1=1
	+ 0x1=0
+ Multiplication:
``` Examples
   11                               1010
  x10                               x101
-----                              -----
   00                               1010
  11                               0000
  110 < the product               1010
                                  110010 <  the product
```  

**Signed Binary**
+ These use one bit to indicate positive or negative
+ An 8 bit **signed binary** number has a max value of 127 and there are 128 (2<sup>7</sup>) different values
+ The left most number (the most significant bit) is used to show positive (0) or negative (1)
```
Examples:
	An 8 bit positive binary number -
		01010011
	An 8 bit negative binary number -
		11010011
```

##Signed Binary with Two's Complement
+ In Two's complement, the most significant bit is used for sign
	+ **0 = Positive**
	+ **1 = Negative**
+ The remaining n-1 bit is used for the absolute value (magnitude)
	+ For example: 8-bit 2's complement binary range from -128 to 127

####Convert Decimal to 2's Complement
1. If the decimal number is positive, the msb is **0**. If the decimal number is negative, the msb is **1**
2. Work out the magnitude of the decimal number in binary (i.e. convert the number into binary)
	+ If the number is negative, invert the binary number and add 1
3. Place the sign bit (0 or 1) at the left-most position of the bit pattern
``` 
Example: Convert -7 into 8-bit 2's complement binary
Step 1. Negative number so sign bit (msb) is 1
Step 2. Decimal 7 in binary        =  000 0111
Step 3. Invert the bits            =  111 1000
Step 4. Add 1 to the inverted bits =  111 1001
Step 5. Place the sign bit         = 1111 1001
```

####Convert 2's Complement to Decimal
1. If the sign bit is 0, the number is postive. The decimal value is the remaining bits.
2. If the sign bit is 1, the number is negative, you then invert the remaining bits and add 1 to get the value of the negative decimal number
```
Example: 1100 0100
Step 1. Sign bit is 1, so it's a negative number
Step 2. Invert the remaining bits:  100 0100
                                    011 1011
Step 3. Add 1 to the inverted bits: 011 1100
Step 4. Work out the value in decimal: 60
Step 5. Decimal number is -60
```

####2's Compliment Addition and Bit Overflow
+ When adding two binary numbers in 2's complement, you simply perform the addition as you would with any binary number.
+ However, things can become undesirable when the resulting sum has more than the fixed number of bits computers used to store numbers.
	+ For example, a computer uses 8-bits to store numbers using 2's compliment, but the resulting sum has 9-bits
+ This problem is called **Overflow**
```
Example:

   01111110
   00111010 +
-------------
   10111000
  
There are 2 problems with this result:
1. The result is a negative number
2. The MSB bit is for the sign bit and the remaining 7-bits is for the value, but this result has 8-bits, which causes overflow (more bits than the computer can store
```

####2's Compliment Subtraction
1. When performing decimal subtraction, for example 12 - 9, you actually perform addition 12 + (-9)
2. The same principle applies to binary numbers, so you change the second binary number to negative, then just perform addition
```
Example: 7 - 1
Step 1. Convert 7 to binary = 0111
Step 2. Convert 1 to binary = 0001
Step 3. Convert 0001 to negative in 2's compliment:
        - Invert the bits = 1110
        - Add 1           = 1111
Step 4. Perform the addition: 0111 + 1111 = 10110
Step 5. Since the result has 5 bits, which is one bit more than the original, the addition has called overflow
        Whenever there is overflow in 2's compliment, you discard the extra bit. So the result is 0110
