## 3.6 Fundamentals of computer systems 

**[Bourne to Code Link](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-6.html)**

## 3.6.1 Hardware  and software
**Hardware**
+ All the physical parts of the computer
	+ For example: motherboard, storage devices, CPU and input and output devices

**Software**
+ The written program that makes the computer works as intended

**Relationship between hardware and software**
+ Hardware needs instructions from software
	+ Uses these instructions to perform its function
+ Software needs hardware to actually carry out the intended tasks 

## 3.6.1.2 Classification of software
**System Software**
+ This is the software needed to run the computer's hardware and **application software**
	+ For example: operating system, virus software, disk degfragmenter and system monitor software

**Application Software**
+ The software that performs one or a set of tasks for users
	+ For example: word processor, browser, graphic software and spreadsheet

## 3.6.1.3 System software
**Four Types of System Software:**
+ **Operating System (OS)**
	+ A set of programs that manage the operations of the computer
	+ It allows users to use computer hardware through application or system software
+ **Utility Software/Programs**
	+ Programs that are designed to help configure, optimise or maintain the computer
	+ For example: scanning virus, firewall, encryption, file backup and restore
+ **Library Programs**
	+ A collection of pre-written programs which allow other programs to run or be developed
	+ For example: Python's numpy, math, random libraries
+ **Programming Language Translators**
	+ These translate software into machine code/object code then run by the computer
	+ For example: compiler, assembler, interpreter

## 3.6.1.4 Role of an Operating System (OS)
**Virtual Machine**
+ An OS creates a virtual machine which allows users to perform tasks without knowing the difficulties of managing and communicating with the underline hardware.

**Multi-Tasking**
+ A computer can only process one word/instruction at a time
+ Tasks may have many intructions so they need to be carried out in turn to give the appearance that they're being processed at the same time
	+ The OS ensures that this happens

**Managing Memory**
+ In a multi-tasking OS, this is allowing multiple programs to be loaded into RAM without corrupting each other
+ Create a virtual memory using a hard disk if necessary

+ Know that the OS handles resource management, managing hardware to allocate processors, memories and I/O devices among competing processes.

## 3.6.2 	Classification of programming languages
+ Show awareness of the development of types of programming languages and their classification into low-and high-level languages.
+ Know that low-level languages are considered to be:
	+ machine-code
	+ assembly language.

+ Know that high-level languages include imperative high level-language.
+ Describe machine-code language and assembly language.
+ Understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine-code and assembly language programming compared with high-level language programming.
+ Explain the term ‘imperative high-level language’ and its relationship to low-level languages.

## 3.6.3 Types of Program Translator
**Programming Translators**

+ They all translate **source code** into **object code** (execubtable machine code)
+ This translates converts source code into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instructions

**The Three Types of Programming Language Translators:**

+ Assembler
	+ Translates assembly code into machine code instructions before it can be executed
	+ Takes each assembly code instruction and converts it into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instruction
	+ The input to an assembler is called the **source code**
	+ The output from and assembler is called the **object code**
+ Compiler
+ Interpreter

+ Explain the differences between compilation and interpretation. Describe situations in which each would be appropriate.

+ Explain why an intermediate language such as bytecode is produced as the final output by some compilers and how it is subsequently used.

+ Understand the difference between source and object (executable) code.
