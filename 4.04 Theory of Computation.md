# 4.4.1 Abstraction and Automation
## 1. Problem-Solving
## 2. Following and Writing Algorithms
**Algorithms**
+ A finite steps of instructions/steps to solve a specific problem, algorithms can be expressed in the following forms:
  + Flowchart
  + Pseudo-Code
  + Structured English
+ Algorithms employ with the standard constructs:
  + Sequence
  + Assignment
  + Selection
  + Iteration
+ **Dry Run** an algorithm means the programmer working through a program on paper, using a table called a **Trace Table**
+ To test a solution, there needs to be a set of test data that will thoroughly test the solution:
  + **Typical Data**: the solution expected data including type and range
  + **Extreme Data**: Data that is on the extreme limits of the range but should be accepted
    + E.g. If the validation says that price <= £100 then £100 should be tested as that is right at the upper limit
  + **Erroneous/Invalid data**: the solution should output error for those data; either because of wrong type or exceeding the limits
  
## 3. Abstraction
+ Abstraction can be achieved by:
  + Representational abstraction: A representation arrived at by removing unnecessary details
  + Abstraction by generalisation or categorisation: a grouping by common characteristics to arrive at a hierarchial relationship of the "is a kind of" type
+ **Procedural Abstraction**:
  + Disregards the actual values, the result of a procedural abstraction is a procedure/computational method, not a function
  + To get a function requires yet another abstraction, which disregards computation method. This is **Functional Abstraction**
+ **Data Abstraction**:
  + Details of how data are actually represented are hidden, allowing new kinds of data objects to be constructed from previously defined types of data
  + E.g. a stack could be implemented as an array and a pointer for the top of a stack. A tree can be implemented as three arrays with one for the left pointer, one for the right pointer and one for the nodes' values

# 4.4.3 Context-Free Languages
## 1. Backus-Naur Form (BNF)/Syntax Diagrams
+ Programmng languages need to follow a set of standard syntax or grammer rules to be translated into machine code. Those rules must be defined unambiguously. Natural languages such as English are not precise and computers cannot under natural languages precisely.
+ **"Defining the syntax of a language:**
  + Regular expressions can be used to define some simple syntax rules. But for some programming language constructs, for example, valid variable names, nested brackets, it is impossible or lengthy to use regular expression.
  + **Backus-Naur Form** is a **meta language** used to define the syntax or grammer rules of programming languages. BNF uses the following meta symbols:
    + ::= means "is defined by"
      + for example: <digit> ::= 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9 which means a digit is defined by 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,or 9
    + ""<digit>"" is called a meta component or syntactic variable
    + Other often used meta components:
      + <letter> ::= a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|o|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z
      + <point>::= .
