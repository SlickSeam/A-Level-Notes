**What is  a turing machine?**
+ It solves a problem by manipulating a string of 1s and 0s
+ A machine that can simulate any computer algorithm, no matter how complicated it is

**What is the halting problem?**
+ The problem of determining, from a description of an arbitrary computer program and an input, whether the program will finish running or continue forever

**What does Turing-complete mean?**
+ A set of data-manipulation rules that can be used to simulate a Turing machine

**What makes a programming language Turing-complete?**]
+ If it can simulate the following:
  + The ability to read and write variables
  + The ability to simulate moving the read/write head
  + The ability to simulate a finite state machine
  + A halt state
