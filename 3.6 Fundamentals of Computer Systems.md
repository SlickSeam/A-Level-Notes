## 3.6 Fundamentals of Computer Systems 

**[Bourne to Code Link](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-6.html)**

## 3.6.1 Hardware and Software
**Hardware**
+ All the physical parts of the computer
	+ For example: motherboard, storage devices, CPU and input and output devices

**Software**
+ The written program that makes the computer works as intended

**Relationship between hardware and software**
+ Hardware needs instructions from software
	+ Uses these instructions to perform its function
+ Software needs hardware to actually carry out the intended tasks 

## 3.6.1.2 Classification of Software
**System Software**
+ This is the software needed to run the computer's hardware and **application software**
	+ For example: operating system, virus software, disk defragmenter, and system monitor software

**Application Software**
+ The software that performs one or a set of tasks for users
	+ For example: word processor, browser, graphic software and spreadsheet

## 3.6.1.3 System Software
**Four Types of System Software:**
+ **Operating System (OS)**
	+ A set of programs that manage the operations of the computer
	+ It allows users to use computer hardware through application or system software
+ **Utility Software/Programs**
	+ Programs that are designed to help configure, optimise or maintain the computer
	+ For example: scanning virus, firewall, encryption, file backup and restore
+ **Library Programs**
	+ A collection of pre-written programs which allow other programs to run or be developed
	+ For example: Python's numpy, math, random libraries
+ **Programming Language Translators**
	+ These translate software into machine code/object code then run by the computer
	+ For example: compiler, assembler, interpreter

## 3.6.1.4 Role of an Operating System (OS)
**Virtual Machine**
+ An OS creates a virtual machine which allows users to perform tasks without knowing the difficulties of managing and communicating with the underline hardware.

**Multi-Tasking**
+ A computer can only process one word/instruction at a time
+ Tasks may have many intructions so they need to be carried out in turn to give the appearance that they're being processed at the same time
	+ The OS ensures that this happens

**Managing Memory**
+ In a multi-tasking OS, this is allowing multiple programs to be loaded into RAM without corrupting each other
+ Create a virtual memory using a hard disk if necessary

####Managing Processes: Process Scheduling
+ **A Scheduler** is a module in OS that **ensures all processes can have access to CPU time and the hardware can be used efficiently**
+ It does this by:
	+ **Processing as many jobs** as possible
	+ Making **maximum use of the CPU time**
	+ **Being responsive** to the user so they are **unaware of a delay** to their process
	+ Making **maximum use of resources such as input-output devices**
	+ Being fair to all jobs (non left stranded for too long)
		+ Does this by being able to **prioritise jobs**
	+ Being able to **alter priorities according to some rules built into the scheduler**
	+ Avoid 'deadlock'
+ **A Scheduler** may use various scheduling algorithms to achieve its goals:
	+ time slicing run Robin
	+ priority scheduling
	+ shortest burst

**Interrupt Handling**
+ An interrupt is a signal from the hardware or software that needs to be dealt with by the OS
+ An interrupt normally causes the OS to halt its current process and handle the interrupt event
+ Interrupt examples include software error and hardware failure
+ Intrerrupts are also used to manage processes, for example:
	+ A hardware interrupt occurs when an I/O operation is completed such as reading some data into the computer from a hard drive.
	+ A software interrupt occurs when an application program terminates or requests certain service from the OS.

**Managing Backing Store**
+ **Backing Store** is the computer's primary data store
	+ For example, a **Hard Disk**
+ All the programs, including the OS itself, need to be loaded from the backing store into RAM in order to work.
+ The OS manages backing store by:
	+ Creating a file system to allow users to create, delete and move files in the file system
	+ Read files from the correct storage devices and locations
	+ Write files to the correct storage devices and locations

**Managing Input and Output (I/O)**
+ The OS manages peripherals (keyboard, mouse, printer, monitor) by:
	+ Communicating with input and output devices
	+ Sending and receiving data from input and output devices

**Providing User Interface**
+ The OS provides a command line (CLI) and a graphic user interface (GUI)
	+ **CLI**: A text based command prompt interface
		+ CLI require specific knowledge of commands to work
		+ Examples: Terminal provided in Linux, Windows and MacOS
	+ **GUI**: Windows, icons, menus and a pointer (WIMP) to allow navigation and open multiple applications in different windows.
		+ Smartphone OS such as iOS and Android uses GUI for user interface

####OS for Embedded Systems
+ **An embedded system** is a computer system with a dedicated function with a larger mechanical or electrical system
+ For example: An embedded system in a washing machine, or microwave oven
+ **An embedded system OS needs to**:
	+ Accept inputs (sensors) and generate outputs (typically in real time)
	+ Have a small number of inputs and outputs
	+ Have minimum user interface
	+ Have no or minimum permanent storage

## 3.6.2 Classification of Programming Languages
####Low and High Level Programming Languages
+ Programming Languages can be considered ```low-level``` or ```high-level``` programming languages
+ **Low-Level** programming languages have a low level of separations of the code from the underlying hardware, are very similar, or  based upon the instruction set of the instruction set of the computer.
	+ Examples: Machine code and assembly code
+ **High-Level** programming languages have a high level of seperation of code from the actual operations of the computer so programmers can focus on solving the problem.
	+ Examples: JAVA, Python, C family languages

####Machine Code
+ **Machine code consists of binary digits**
+ A **typical machine code instruction **consists of operation code (opcode) and the **operand**
+ **Opcode** represents the instruction to be executed
+ **Operand** represents the value or the address of the value to be operated on
+ Fictional examples of machine code operation opcode:
```
0000	load the value in memory location stored in the operand into the accumulator
0001	store the value in the accumulator in memory location as specified by the operand.
0010	add the value in the accumulator to the value at the address specified by the operand
0011	store the value in the accumulator to address as specified by the operand
```
+ So, using the above opcode in a 8-bit instruction. to add two numbers together, the machine code would look something like this:
```
0000 0001	load the value stored at address 0001 into accumulator
0010 0010	add the value stored at 0010 to the value in accumulator
0011 0011	store the value in accumulator (the sum) at location 011
```

####Assembly Code
+ After machine code, a second generation programming language was developed to make the code easier to read, it's called assembly code
+ It has improved the machine code in two ways:
	+ The opcode was no longer binary digits, it **uses words or strings which are easier to remember**
	+ The **operand was replaced by a decimal or hex number**
+ Each assembly language is specific to a particular computer architecture, in contrast to most high-level programming languages, which are generally portable across multiple architectures, but require more interpreting or compiling
+ Example of what assembly code would look like:
```
LDA 8	load the contents of location 8 into accumulator
STO 10	store content in accumulator in location 10
ADX 10	add the content of location 10 to the value in the accumulator
PRT 10	print the contents at location specified
```
+ To use the above assembly code to add two values, the code would look like
```
LDA 8	Load data at location 8 into accumulator	 
ADX 10	add value at location 10 to the value in the accumulator
```

##High-Level Programming Languages
+ **Low-Level Programming Languages** like machine code and assembly code have some **disadvantages**:
	1. They are **platform dependent**
	2. **Difficult to write as it requires hardware specific knowledge** (instruction set)
	3. **Difficult to read and debug**
+ **High-Level Programming Languages** allow programmers to focus on problem solving algorithms not concerned with how computers execute each instruction and how data are fetched and stored
+ **Imperative High-Level Programming Languages**: Each statement is a command to perform something such as assigning values, calling functions etc.

##3.6.3 Types of Program Translator
**Programming Translators**
+ They all translate **source code** into **object code** (execubtable machine code)
+ This translates converts source code into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instructions

**The Three Types of Programming Language Translators:**
+ Assembler
	+ Translates assembly code into machine code instructions before it can be executed
	+ Takes each assembly code instruction and converts it into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instruction
	+ The input to an assembler is called the **source code**
	+ The output from and assembler is called the **object code**
+ Compiler
	+ A compiler is a program that translates programming languages such as JAVA, C, C++ into executable machine code
	+ It goes through the source code several times to build up necessary information for outputting the object code
	+ The object code can be saved an executed later without the need for a compiler
+ Interpreter
	+ An interpreter checks the entire source code line by line for syntax errors. If no errors are found, it then translates each into machine code and executes it
		+ E.g. Python, Perl, Matlab 

**Interpreter or Compiler**
+ **Advantages of a Compiler Over an Interpreter**
	+ The object code can be stored on disk and can be run without the need to be compiled
		+ However, if errors are found later, corrections need to be made to the source, then recompiling is needed
	+ The object code can be distributed and executed without a compiler present
	+ The object code executes faster than interpreted code
	+ The object code is more secure since it cannot be easily reverse engineered in order to be read
+ **Advantages of an Interpreter Over a Compiler**
	+ It is easier to partially test programs
	+ No need for long recompilation whenever an error is found
+ **Disadvantages of an Interpreter**
	+ Interpreted programs may run slower as each statement has to be translated into machine code each time it is encountered

*Understand the difference between source and object (executable) code.*

## Intermediate Code
**Intermediate code**
+ **Intermediate code** is the intermediate compiled product between the source code and the machine code
+ It's more efficient if the computer (or interpreter) only translates the code to intermediate code, and leaves the translation of the intermediate code to the other party
+ It can be run in a "virtual" machine, which allows the code to run faster than interpreted code

**Byte Code**
+ This is the intermediate compiled product between the source code and the machine code.
+ It's executed by a byte code interpreter
+ It may be compiled once, as in JAVA, or each time a change in the source code is detected, as in Python
+ It can be interpreted on different platforms, achieving platform independence
+ Since it's interpreted by a byte code interpreted, it adds an extra security layer to guard against malicious programs
+ Programs written in different programming language may be compiled into bytecode of a different programming language and be executed by that language's byte code interpreter.
	+ Jython is an example of compiler for compiling Python into JAVA byte code
