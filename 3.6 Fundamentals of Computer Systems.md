## 3.6 Fundamentals of Computer Systems 

**[Bourne to Code Link](https://bournetocode.com/projects/AQA_AS_Theory/pages/3-6.html)**

## 3.6.1 Hardware and Software
**Hardware**
+ All the physical parts of the computer
	+ For example: motherboard, storage devices, CPU and input and output devices

**Software**
+ The written program that makes the computer works as intended

**Relationship between hardware and software**
+ Hardware needs instructions from software
	+ Uses these instructions to perform its function
+ Software needs hardware to actually carry out the intended tasks 

## 3.6.1.2 Classification of Software
**System Software**
+ This is the software needed to run the computer's hardware and **application software**
	+ For example: operating system, virus software, disk degfragmenter and system monitor software

**Application Software**
+ The software that performs one or a set of tasks for users
	+ For example: word processor, browser, graphic software and spreadsheet

## 3.6.1.3 System Software
**Four Types of System Software:**
+ **Operating System (OS)**
	+ A set of programs that manage the operations of the computer
	+ It allows users to use computer hardware through application or system software
+ **Utility Software/Programs**
	+ Programs that are designed to help configure, optimise or maintain the computer
	+ For example: scanning virus, firewall, encryption, file backup and restore
+ **Library Programs**
	+ A collection of pre-written programs which allow other programs to run or be developed
	+ For example: Python's numpy, math, random libraries
+ **Programming Language Translators**
	+ These translate software into machine code/object code then run by the computer
	+ For example: compiler, assembler, interpreter

## 3.6.1.4 Role of an Operating System (OS)
**Virtual Machine**
+ An OS creates a virtual machine which allows users to perform tasks without knowing the difficulties of managing and communicating with the underline hardware.

**Multi-Tasking**
+ A computer can only process one word/instruction at a time
+ Tasks may have many intructions so they need to be carried out in turn to give the appearance that they're being processed at the same time
	+ The OS ensures that this happens

**Managing Memory**
+ In a multi-tasking OS, this is allowing multiple programs to be loaded into RAM without corrupting each other
+ Create a virtual memory using a hard disk if necessary

+ Know that the OS handles resource management, managing hardware to allocate processors, memories and I/O devices among competing processes.

## 3.6.2 Classification of Programming Languages
+ Show awareness of the development of types of programming languages and their classification into low-and high-level languages.
+ Know that low-level languages are considered to be:
	+ machine-code
	+ assembly language.

+ Know that high-level languages include imperative high level-language.
+ Describe machine-code language and assembly language.
+ Understand the advantages and disadvantages of machine-code and assembly language programming compared with high-level language programming.
+ Explain the term ‘imperative high-level language’ and its relationship to low-level languages.

## 3.6.3 Types of Program Translator
**Programming Translators**

+ They all translate **source code** into **object code** (execubtable machine code)
+ This translates converts source code into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instructions

**The Three Types of Programming Language Translators:**

+ Assembler
	+ Translates assembly code into machine code instructions before it can be executed
	+ Takes each assembly code instruction and converts it into 0s and 1s of the corresponding machine code instruction
	+ The input to an assembler is called the **source code**
	+ The output from and assembler is called the **object code**
+ Compiler
	+ A compiler is a program that translates programming languages such as JAVA, C, C++ into executable machine code
	+ It goes through the source code several times to build up necessary information for outputting the object code
	+ The object code can be saved an executed later without the need for a compiler
+ Interpreter
	+ An interpreter checks the entire source code line by line for syntax errors. If no errors are found, it then translates each into machine code and executes it
		+ E.g. Python, Perl, Matlab 

**Interpreter or Compiler**
+ Advantages of a Compiler Over an Interpreter
	+ The object code can be stored on disk and can be run without the need to be compiled
		+ However, if errors are found later, corrections need to be made to the source, then recompiling is needed
	+ The object code can be distributed and executed without a compiler present
	+ The object code executes faster than interpreted code
	+ The object code is more secure since it cannot be easily reverse engineered in order to be read
+ Advantages of an Interpreter Over a Compiler
	+ It is easier to partially test programs
	+ No need for long recompilation whenever an error is found
+ Disadvantages of an Interpreter
	+ Interpreted programs may run slower as each statement has to be translated into machine code each time it is encountered

+ Explain why an intermediate language such as bytecode is produced as the final output by some compilers and how it is subsequently used.

+ Understand the difference between source and object (executable) code.

## Intermediate Code
+ **Intermediate code** is the intermediate compiled product between the source code and the machine code
+ It's more efficient if the computer (or interpreter) only translates the code to intermediate code, and leaves the translation of the intermediate code to the other party
+ It can be run in a "virtual" machine, which allows the code to run faster than interpreted code

**Byte Code**
+ This is the intermediate compiled product between the source code and the machine code.
+ It's executed by a byte code interpreter
+ It may be compiled once, as in JAVA, or each time a change in the source code is detected, as in Python
+ It can be interpreted on different platforms, achieving platform independence
+ Since it's interpreted by a byte code interpreted, it adds an extra security layer to guard against malicious programs
+ Programs written in different programming language may be compiled into bytecode of a different programming language and be executed by that language's byte code interpreter.
	+ Jython is an example of compiler for compiling Python into JAVA byte code
