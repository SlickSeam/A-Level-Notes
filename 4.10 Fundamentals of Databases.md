## Database Normalisation
**Database normalisation** is the process to make a database model more efficient. The purpose of normalisation is to have a database structure in the third normal form
**First Normal Form**
+ A table is said to be in **first normal form** if:
  + it has no repeating attribute/field or groups of attributes
  + and it only contains atomic values
