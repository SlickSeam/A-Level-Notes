#Database Normalisation
**Database normalisation** is the process to make a database model more efficient. The purpose of normalisation is to have a database structure in the third normal form
##First Normal Form (1NF)
+ A table is said to be in **first normal form** if:
  + it has no repeating attribute/field or groups of attributes
  + and it only contains atomic values
* Look at the table below. For each record, it has 3 attributes: **name**, **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate**.
  + It's not in first normal form since it contains repeating groups of attributes for the two attributes: **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate**
  
| name | courseEnrolled | courseFinishDate |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Peter Parker | Maths, Biology | 12/12/2015, 01/08/2016 |
| Mary Jane | Maths, English | 29/04/2015, 21/05/2016 |

* To make the above table in first normal form, we need to make **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate** contain only one/atomic value. To do this, another table, courses, will be needed which should be a different entity anyway:

**course(--courseID--, courseName)**

(-- = underlined)

| courseID | courseName |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Maths |
| 2 | Biology |
| 3 | English |

* Then the pupils can be changed to be in first normal form:

| pupilID | name |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Peter Parker |
| 2 | Mary Jane |

* A third table will be need to link the pupil and the course table togther

**enrollment(--courseID--, --pupilID--, courseLocation)**

##Second Normal Form (2NF)
+ A table is said to be in **second normal form** if:
  + It is in first normal form
  + and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary
  + This is partially dependent on the primary key and only occurs if there's a composite key
+ Look at the table below:

| pupilID | courseID | courseLocation | finishDate |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 1 | Bourne | |
| 1 | 2 | Peterborough | |

1. The above table has a **composite key** which are the two attributes **pupilID** and **courseID** that have been combined to uniquely identify a record
2. The attribute **courseLocation** is not fully dependent on the composite key (also the primary key). It partially depends on the courseID
3. To make the above table in the second normal form, the courseLocation attribute should be in the course table:

| courseID | courseName | courseLocation |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Java | Bourne |
| 2 | Perl | Stamford |
| 1 | Perl | Peterborough |

##Third Normal Form (3NF)
+ A table is said to be in **third normal form** if:
  + It is in the second normal form
  + And there is no non-key dependencies, or no attributes dependent or other attributes
  + **All attributes are dependent on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key**
