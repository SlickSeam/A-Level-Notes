## Database Normalisation
**Database normalisation** is the process to make a database model more efficient. The purpose of normalisation is to have a database structure in the third normal form
**First Normal Form**
+ A table is said to be in **first normal form** if:
  + it has no repeating attribute/field or groups of attributes
  + and it only contains atomic values
1. Look at the table below. For each record, it has 3 attributes: **name**, **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate**.
  + It's not in first normal form since it contains repeating groups of attributes for the two attributes: **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate**
  
| name | courseEnrolled | courseFinishDate |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Peter Parker | Maths, Biology | 12/12/2015, 01/08/2016 |
| Mary Jane | Maths, English | 29/04/2015, 21/05/2016 |

2. To make the above table in first normal form, we need to make **courseEnrolled** and **courseFinishDate** contain only one/atomic value. To do this, another table, courses, will be needed which should be a different entity anyway:

**course(--courseID--, courseName)**

(-- = underlined)

| courseID | courseName |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Maths |
| 2 | Biology |
| 3 | English |

3. Then the pupils can be changed to be in first normal form:

| pupilID | name |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Peter Parker |
| 2 | Mary Jane |

4. A third table will be need to link the pupil and the course table togther

**enrollment(--courseID--, --pupilID--, courseLocation)**
